## Introduction

Introduction on abortion laws and motivation

## Description of the original paper

In "Abortion laws reform may reduce maternal mortality: an ecological study in 162 countries," @Latt2019 present the results of a study that aims to assess whether maternal mortality is affected by the flexibility of abortion laws. Abortion law flexibility was measured as a sum of the number of reasons for which abortion is legally allowed (ranging from 0 to 7) and was included in models as both an ordinal variable and a binary variable (inflexible vs. flexible abortion laws). Abortion laws were considered inflexible if there were less than 3 legal grounds for abortion. Maternal mortality ratio (MMR) was measured as the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Authors used fixed effects linear regression models to estimate the relationship between abortion law flexibility and MMR, while controlling for GDP per capita and time in five-year intervals. Additional analysis included also female primary education completion as a control variable as it had over 50% of missing data; however, results did not change. Results indicated that maternal deaths reduce by 45 per 100,000 live births (95% CI: -64, -26) with flexible abortion laws. Authors conclude that abortion law reform in countries with inflexible abortion laws may reduce maternal mortality.    


##  Methodology


### Theorethical estimands

Theoretical estimand is a key part of a research question, as it describes the quantity of interest independently of statistical models and clearly describes the research goal [@Lundberg2021]. In the current paper, the theorethical estimand was not specifically stated; however, we tried to deduce the desired estimand from the research goal and the estimation strategy authors used.

The authors state that they aim to “estimate the association between the flexibility of abortion laws and maternal mortality at a country level [between 1985 and 2013]” [@Latt2019, pg. 2]. Furthermore, they estimated the model using linear regression, and the quantity they have estimated was the regression coefficient of MMR on flexibility of the law. Therefore, we we believe that the authors wanted to assess the average treatment effect (ATE), that is, the difference in the number of maternal deaths that would occur within a country if abortion law was flexible ($Y_i$ = 1) versus inflexible ($Y_i$ = 0):

$$
ATE = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i^1 - Y_i^0) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\Delta Y_i = \mathbb{E} [\Delta Y]
$$
This estimand looks at counterfactual outcomes for all countries, regardless of the fact that the particular country would in reality receive treatment or not. Country $i$'s MMR when abortion laes are flexible is denoted as $Y_i^{(L=1)}$ or shortly $Y_i^{(1)}$, and as $Y_i^{(L=0)}$ or $Y_i^{(0)}$ when abortion laws are inflexible. Individual causal effect for the country $i$ is then the difference between mortality when abortion laws are flexible vs. when they are inflexible, or $ΔY_i = Y_i^{(1)} - Y_i^{(0)}$. Individual effects averaged across all of the countries in the world would then give the wanted causal quantity. This is equal to the expectation of the effect of flexible abortion laws on MMR of a randomly selected country. 

As ATE reflects the effect of the treatment for the entire study population, it can be particularly useful for scoping the benefit of population-wide policies. However, as there will be inevitable self-selection to treatment in case of abortion policies -- some countries will choose to have more flexible laws and some will choose less flexible laws -- there are other estimands that could potentially be interesting for researchers in this particular case.

In fact, one interpretation of the results that authors give is that "it is possible that maternal mortality would reduce in [countries with low abortion flexibility scores] if legal, safe abortion was more readily available" [@Lundberg2021, pg. 6, para. 2]. This would indicate that they might actually be interested in the ATU - the average effect of the treatment on the untreated, that is, for the population of units that did not receive the treatment:

$$
ATU = \mathbb{E}[Y^{(1)} - Y^{(0)} \mid L = 0]
$$
ATU shows how the outcome would differ if untreated units were actually treated, in other words, the effect of expanding the treatment. This could potentially be the most useful estimand in this study, as it could be used in considering the expansion of a medical practice to units that were previously untreated [@greifer2021].  

Another potentially interesting estimand is the ATT, that is, the effect of the treatment for the population of units that actually received the treatment:

$$
ATT = \mathbb{E}[Y^{(1)} - Y^{(0)} \mid L = 1]
$$

ATT shows how the outcome would differ if treated units were actually not treated, in other words, the effect of the withholding the treatment from the ones who would otherwise receive it [@greifer2021]. In light of recent policy changes and reductions of abortion flexibility laws in the USA, ATT could be particularly relevant.

### Identification

For each country $i$ it is not possible to observe both potential outcomes, so a theoretical estimand is not an empirical quantity. As this is an observational study, where the treatment is not assigned in a random way but rather observed, there are several assumptions that need to be made to be able to estimate causal effects.

First, effects cannot be estimated if there is unmeasured counfounding. This means that all common causes of treatment assignment and the outcome must be included in the analysis. The current paper proposes that flexibility of abortion laws causes maternal mortality, and that GDP and female primary education completion are confounders of this relationship -- that is, they cause both whether or not a country will have flexible abortion laws and how big MMR will be. They also propose that the causal mechanism by which this relationship comes about is that the women in countries where restrictive laws are in place are less able (or unable) to access reproductive health care and safe abortion services, which increases the proportion of unsafe abortions, and in turn, maternal deaths. The model can be seen in the figure below:

</center>



```{r}
dag  <- dagify(MMR ~ Abortion_law_flexibility + GDP + Female_primary_education + 
                 Access_to_safe_abortion + Unsafe_abortions,
               Abortion_law_flexibility ~ GDP + Female_primary_education,
               Access_to_safe_abortion ~ Abortion_law_flexibility,
               Unsafe_abortions ~ Access_to_safe_abortions
               )
ggdag(dag) +  theme_dag_blank()
```


The second assumption is that of positivity, meaning that all units of analysis should have a nonzero probability of receiving either treatment.

Finally, the third requirement is the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA), meaning that there are no unmeasured versions of treatment and that the treatment status of any other unit does not affect other unit's outcomes. 


```{r}
dag  <- dagify(MMrates ~ laws,
               MMrates ~ GDP,
               MMrates ~ literacy,
               laws ~ GDP,
               laws~literacy
               )
ggdag(dag) +  theme_dag_blank()
```
